{{ attendee.first_name }},

Thanks again for coming out to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} as a Guest! As we've previously mentioned, we feed our guests hot meals during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, so you can drop by the Staff Suite in the Retreat building on the 3rd floor in Retreat I (across the hall from Room 324) for hot food during any of the following times:

Breakfast: 8:00 am to 12:00 pm
Dinner & Overnight: 4:00 pm to 4:00 am (or until the hot food has run out, whichever occurs first)

Between meals, the suite will be open for snacks and beverages.

The first meal served will be breakfast on Friday morning, and the suite will remain open through Sunday afternoon.

If necessary food may be taken to go, but we cannot allow to go meals to be picked up for those who are not present to ensure we do not run out of food. Also, please keep in mind that the Staff Suite is restricted to guest, staff, and volunteers only. Regular attendees are not eligible for access to the room. 

The menu for the weekend can be found at http://magfe.st/labs/menu.

Don't forget to fill out your food restrictions. Please let us know if you have any questions.

We look forward to seeing you in the Staff Suite!
