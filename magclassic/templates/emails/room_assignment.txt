This email is to confirm your upcoming {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} hotel staff room assignments. Your roommates are listed below, so please take a moment to look over the information. We will assume that your room is ok if you donâ€™t reply to this email by {{ c.ONE_WEEK_OR_TAKEDOWN_OR_EPOCH|datetime_local }}.

You can check in at the hotel front desk starting at {{ c.CHECK_IN_TIME }} on {{ room.check_in_date|datetime("%A, %b %-d") }}.
PLEASE - Make sure this is the first thing you do when you get onsite. If you have problems, come to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff Operations Department to get it resolved.

Your check-out is at {{ c.CHECK_OUT_TIME }} on {{ room.check_out_date|datetime("%A, %b %-d") }}. You do not need to drop off your room keys at the front desk; all you need to do is simply vacate the room by that time. If for any reason you need additional time to vacate the room, please call the hotel front desk to see if you can have additional time. If the hotel provides additional time, then you need to comply with the time provided. Do not expect that this will be provided.

Here are the people assigned to this room, along with their contact information and what nights they'll be using the room:
{% for ra in room.assignments %}
-> {{ ra.attendee.full_name }} ({{ ra.attendee.email }}){% if ra.attendee.cellphone %} [{{ ra.attendee.cellphone }}]{% endif %}: {{ ra.attendee.hotel_requests.nights_display }}
{% endfor %}

This year in particular has been difficult for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff Rooms. If your room assignment isn't like what you've requested, please understand that your patience with the rough rooming situation helps out {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} immensely. We've had to cut room nights for many staff on Thursday and Sunday nights. These cuts were discussed with department heads, who felt that it was better to cut room nights than run the risk of Labs going over budget. That being said, if there is an irreconcilable issue with your room assignment, please let us know so we can adjust your room assignment.

If there are any roommates related issues with your room at event, please come to Staff Operations and let one of the Operations Staff know. We will work with the hotel liaison team in an attempt to resolved your issue as soon as possible. We appreciate your hard work and we hope that you enjoy {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.
