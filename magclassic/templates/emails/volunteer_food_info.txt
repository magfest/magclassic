{{ attendee.first_name }},

Thanks again for volunteering at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} this year. We feed our volunteers three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, so you can drop by the Staff Suite in the Retreat building on the 3rd floor in Retreat I (across the hall from Room 324) for food at anytime during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} for a snack or drink. Meals will be served at the following times:

Breakfast: 8:00 am to 12:00 pm
Dinner & Overnight: 4:00 pm to 4:00 am (or until the hot food has run out, whichever occurs first)

Between meals, the suite will be open for snacks and beverages.

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.ATTENDEE_BADGE %}You will become eligible for food after working your first shift if you have signed up for at least 12 hours. Please come to Staffing Ops (in the Fest Ops room) after you first get your badge to get your shift schedule, and then come back to get your ribbon marked after working your first shift and getting your department head to sign your sheet. You will not be able to get snacks, drinks, or meals without your volunteer ribbon being properly marked.

{% endif %}The first meal served will be breakfast on Friday morning, and the suite will remain open through Sunday afternoon.

If you are working load in on Thursday night, there will be a meal late that night starting around 8pm. This meal is only for those who are scheduled for load in shifts. Those that are not scheduled for load in shifts may begin receiving meals Friday morning at 7am.

If necessary food may be taken to go, but we cannot allow to go meals to be picked up for those who are not present to ensure we do not run out of food. Also, please keep in mind that the Staff Suite is restricted to guest, staff, and volunteers only. Regular attendees are not eligible for access to the room. 

The menu for the weekend can be found at http://magfe.st/labs/menu.

Donâ€™t forget to fill out your food restrictions. Please let us know if you have any questions.

We look forward to seeing you in the Staff Suite!
