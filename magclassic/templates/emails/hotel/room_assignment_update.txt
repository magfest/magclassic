This email is to confirm your upcoming {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} hotel staff room assignments.  Changes were made following the original email, so please use this communication as your confirmed roommates for the event. Your roommates are listed below, so please take a moment to look over the information.
You can check in at the hotel front desk starting at {{ c.CHECK_IN_TIME }} on {{ room.check_in_date|datetime("%A, %b %-d") }}.
PLEASE - Make sure this is the first thing you do when you get onsite. If you have problems, come to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff Operations Department to get it resolved.

Your check-out is at {{ c.CHECK_OUT_TIME }} on {{ room.check_out_date|datetime("%A, %b %-d") }}.  You do not need to drop off your room keys at the front desk; all you need to do is simply vacate the room by that time.  If for any reason you need additional time to vacate the room, please call the hotel front desk to see if you can have additional time.  If the hotel provides additional time, then you need to comply with the time provided.  Do not expect that this will be provided.
Some people may need to shift rooms to adjust for load-in and load-out. We thank you for your flexibility. Please remember that on days you change rooms, you will need to vacate your room as normal, and will be responsible for communicating with your roommates in your new room.

Here are the people assigned to this room, along with their contact information and what nights they'll be using the room:
{% for ra in room.assignments %}
-> {{ ra.attendee.full_name }} ({{ ra.attendee.email }}){% if ra.attendee.cellphone %} [{{ ra.attendee.cellphone }}]{% endif %}: {{ ra.attendee.hotel_requests.nights_display }}
{% endfor %}

{% if room.message %}{{ room.message }}

{% endif %}Again, PLEASE - Make sure that checking into your room is the first thing you do when you get onsite. If you have problems in that process, come to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff Operations Department to get it resolved.  If there are any roommates related issues with your room at event, please come to Staff Operations and let one of the Operations Staff know.  We will work with the hotel liaison team in an attempt to resolve your issue as soon as possible.  We appreciate your hard work and we hope that you enjoy {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.
