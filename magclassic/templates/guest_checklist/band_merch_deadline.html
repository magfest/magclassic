    All performers are entitled to merch table space in the concert hall on the evening of their set. Performers are
    responsible for ensuring their merch tables are staffed during this time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, space for merchandise sales may be provided at our Rock Island area, where MAGFest Laboratories staff
    sell performer-provided merchandise throughout the festival. Using Rock Island is highly recommended as it enables
    performers to sell merchandise for the duration of the event without requiring them to staff a table. If a performer
    opts out of Rock Island and would instead prefer to staff their own table in our Marketplace area for the duration
    of the event, a discounted rate of $30 per marketplace table is available.

      It is recommended, but not required, for {{ guest.group_type_label|lower }}s to use our Rock Island service in
      this area, as merchandise can be sold more consistently, and for many more hours.
