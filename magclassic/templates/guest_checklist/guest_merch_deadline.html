    Space for merchandise sales may be provided at our Rock Island area, where MAGFest Laboratories staff
    sell guest-provided merchandise throughout the festival. Using Rock Island is highly recommended as it enables
    performers to sell merchandise for the duration of the event without requiring them to staff a table. If a guest
    opts out of Rock Island and would instead prefer to staff their own table in our Marketplace area for the duration
    of the event, a discounted rate of $30 per marketplace table is available.

      It is recommended, but not required, for {{ guest.group_type_label|lower }}s to use our Rock Island service in
      this area, as merchandise can be sold more consistently, and for many more hours.
